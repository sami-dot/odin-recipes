        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a worldwide favorite, known for its layers of rich, flavorful ingredients and comforting appeal. The recipe typically starts with a robust meat sauce made from ground beef or sausage, simmered with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and aromatic herbs like basil and oregano. This savory mixture is then layered between sheets of pasta, along with creamy ricotta cheese, gooey mozzarella, and a sprinkle of Parmesan to add a cheesy, golden topping. The combination of textures and flavors in every bite makes lasagna a beloved dish for family dinners, gatherings, or special occasions.</p>

            What makes lasagna truly versatile is the ability to customize it to suit different tastes and dietary needs. Vegetarians can enjoy a hearty vegetable lasagna filled with zucchini, spinach, and mushrooms, while those seeking a lighter option might opt for a white lasagna with chicken and Alfredo sauce. Whether served fresh out of the oven or reheated the next day, lasagna retains its delightful layers of flavor and comforting warmth, making it a timeless favorite that brings people together around the dinner table.
